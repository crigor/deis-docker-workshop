## Mac OS X

First, install [boot2docker (latest)](https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases/latest).

Then, in a terminal run:

```sh
$ boot2docker init                  # Download the boot2docker ISO & Setup SSH key
$ boot2docker start                 # Start the VM and Docker Daemon
$ eval "$(boot2docker shellinit)    # Create certs and setup shell
```

## Linux

* Use the official installation shell script: `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh`
 * To see what the script does, view [https://get.docker.com/](https://get.docker.com/)
 * *Most distros have a much-too-old version of Docker in their package repositories* - using this script should give us the latest
 
## Confirming Successful Installation

To confirm Docker is working properly run `docker info`.
